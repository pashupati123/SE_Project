    <p>India, its technological advancement notwithstanding, is predominately an agricultural country. People still depend upon agriculture for their livelihood, and a large part of land is still under cultivation in various parts of the country. Our agricultural tour offers you an opportunity to explore these places that exhibit a unique beauty of their own. Vast stretches of land glowing with lush green and yellow cultivation will expose you to what is quite often referred to as "true India." It is an exceptional way to discover those glorious culture and customs of the country, that are well preserved in the agricultural places but seems to have been lost in the urban areas</p>
